# Graph Implementation with Adjacency Matrix

The graph implementation uses adjacency matrix to store the vertex and edge info.

Graph functions included are topological sort, Dijkstras, larget connected component, Prim's MST.

Refer to the pdf for detailed problem statement,

To compile the code,
```shell
g++ graph_driver.cpp graph.cpp vertex.cpp -o main
```

To run the program,
```bash
./main
```
